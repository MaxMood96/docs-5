You should migrate from LDAP to Workforce Identity Federation (OIDC
authentication) for human users and Workload Identity Federation (OAuth
2.0) for programmatic users.

With Workforce Identity Federation, you can manage human user access to
Atlas Clusters from any identity provider that supports OIDC, including
Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, and Ping Identity.

With Workload Identity Federation, you can manage application access to
Atlas Clusters from any authorization system that supports OAuth 2.0.
You can use cloud provider application users, which include Azure
Service Principals, Azure Managed Identities, and Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) service accounts.

Get Started
-----------

To get started with Workforce and Workload Identity Federation in Atlas,
see:

- :atlas:`Atlas Workforce Identity Federation </workforce-oidc>`
- :atlas:`Atlas Workload Identity Federation </workload-oidc>`

To get started with Workforce Identity Federation in MongoDB server,
see :ref:`authentication-oidc`.

.. COMMENT Add the following link and adjust bullet introduction later to above list
.. COMMENT - :ref:`Workforce external provider </workforce-external-provider>`

LDAP migration information will be available in the future.

Details
-------

The following sections describe additional details with the advantages
of Workforce and Workload Identity Federation compared to LDAP.

Atlas and Atlas for Government
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Cost efficiency:** For Atlas Developer and Pro support, LDAP has a fee
as part of the Advanced Security package. Workforce and Workload
Identity Federation don't have an additional fee. For pricing, see:

- `MongoDB Pricing <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing>`_
- :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Additional Services </billing/additional-services>`
- `Atlas Support Plans
  <https://www.mongodb.com/services/support/atlas-support-plans>`_

**Improved network security:** LDAP requires a public Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN), which creates a potential firewall vulnerability.
With Workforce Identity Federation, you can use an Internet connected
Identity Provider (IdP) and synchronize part of the user directory to
your IdP to improve security with Workforce Identity Federation.

**Improved credentials handling:** Unlike LDAP, user credentials aren't
sent to or stored in MongoDB with Identity Federation.

**Modern authentication policies for human users:** Workforce Identity
Federation allows authentication through IdP, which enables the use of
modern authentication policies.

**Simple configuration:** LDAP users require a complex network
configuration for Atlas. Identity Federation has a simpler
configuration.

**Authentication without passwords for application users:** Identity
Federation supports authentication without passwords for applications
running on specific cloud resources. This also eliminates periodically
renewing credentials.

**Improved security with access tokens:** Identity Federation grants
access through short term access tokens, which improves security when
compared to LDAP. Access tokens are typically valid for one hour. The
time period can be customized based on the identity provider.

MongoDB Server On-premises Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the last two points in the previous list, MongoDB
on-premises server implementations also have the following additional
consideration:

**Reduced cross-application risk:** With OIDC and OAuth 2.0, access
tokens are granted for specific resources using audience claims. If a
token is compromised, the token has a limited lifetime and scope to
limit access.
